# FIFTH

This is my personal blog devoted to...really anything that comes on my mind. Sometimes I'll be critical, sometimes I'll try to be funny and sometimes I'll just share something I find interesting. This is basically my wall of scribbles, notes that I've put together hoping to make some sense out of them.

## Creating new post

My workflow is - fork the master and name the branch pages-... where '...' is the name of the post. I do all of my drafting there and when I feel ready, I publish the post online by merging the branch into the master.

## Deployment

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/svachmic/svachmic.github.io.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/svachmic/svachmic.github.io)

The blog is deployed via GitHub pages, using Travis CI to check everything and to make sure I didn't break anything. Travis handles everything for me regarding crosslink validation, CSS linking etc. Pretty neat, eh?
